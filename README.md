This repo contains basic settings to work on most Terminal-Emulators with 256-Color Support. Its tested on Raspbian Stretch and the termux App for Android. To work on all platforms there no plugins or escapes, so it should run on Mac-OS as well. You wont need any Powerline Fonts.

To Use the zsh-shell Theme you will have to install oh-my-zsh and set it as theme in the .zshrc, to use the Vim configs you have to install the Vundle Plugin Manager. The tmux settings are standalone.

Vim-Setup, contains basic Plugins and settings for Coding in Python and Rust, the colorscheme is PaperColor with transparent BG and optimized settings for Python and C, the Statusbar is created by mescarune and modified to fit for PaperColor.

Tmux-Setup, provides nice Keybinds for Vim users to switch between tabs and panes, some neccessary settings, nothing special and a surface to fit for the PaperColor Vim theme. You only see what you realy need to see.

Zsh-Setup, is a very basic prompt with git support, theres only the current working directory and the git info shown, the colors fit to the PaperColor Theme too.
